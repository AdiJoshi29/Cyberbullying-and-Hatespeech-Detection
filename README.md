# Cyberbullying-and-Hatespeech-Detection
This was a year long project where my team and I worked on online hatespeech detection.
The Kaggle Dataset "Dataset for detection of cyber trolls" was used.
Preprocessing includes tokenization, Porter's Stemming Algorithm and Cosine distance.
We have created a neural network to detect cyberbullying. It's performance was compared to multiple classifiers and a pre trained BERT model.
We also attempted to integrate our model with Telegram for real time Hatespeech detection.
